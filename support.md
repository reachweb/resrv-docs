## About

Hello! I'm Iosif, a web developer and designer from Kos, Greece. With 20 years of experience, I've journeyed through various technologies, from Wordpress & Joomla to discovering the rad path of web creation. Yes, I'm talking about Statamic!

In 2012, I founded **Reach Web Agency**, and since then, I've worked with numerous coders and designers. We've been exclusively using Statamic since 2020, and our clients love it! As the primary developer in our team, I've created several Statamic add-ons, which you can find on our [store page](https://statamic.com/sellers/reach).

I'm also part of the Statamic Certified Partners Program and I'm regularly active in the Statamic community.

## Support

I'm always happy to assist with any issues you encounter. However, please note that Resrv is provided as-is, and I can't guarantee immediate support for urgent issues.

If you need help with Resrv, you can reach out to me:

- **Open an issue on GitHub**: If you find a problem with the addon or have a feature request, submit an issue on the [Resrv GitHub repository](https://github.com/reachweb/statamic-resrv/issues).
- **Email**: Feel free to email me at info@reach.gr. I typically respond within a day or two.

Don't hesitate to get in touch! I really enjoy learning how people use Resrv and I'm always happy to help.

## Paid Support

If you need dedicated support for Resrv or help with Statamic, Laravel, or Livewire, I can assist you. Contact me for an estimate. As a registered EU business, I can provide invoicing for any services.

## Pricing

Resrv is not free. You can use it for free during development, but you'll need to [purchase a license](https://statamic.com/addons/reach/resrv) before going live.

Given the work that's gone into it and the types of websites it's designed for, I believe the price is fair. However, if you're unable to afford it or are using Resrv for a non-profit or open-source project, feel free to reach out to me.
