# Options

Options are a great way to add a bit of flexibility to your Reservations. They are similar to Extras, but they are less advanced and bound to each Entry by default. You can read the diferences between Extras and Options in the [Extras](./extras#extras-or-options) docs.

## Managing Options

To manage your Options, you need to add the `Resrv Options` field to your Blueprint.
