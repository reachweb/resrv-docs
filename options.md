# Options

Options are a great way to add a bit of flexibility to your Reservations. They are similar to Extras, but they are less advanced and bound to each Entry by default. You can read the diferences between Extras and Options in the [Extras](./extras#extras-or-options) docs.

## Managing Options

To manage your Options, you need to add the `Resrv Options` field to your Blueprint. Then in your entry you can add as many options as you want.

Each option can be `Required` or `Optional`. If an option is required, the user will have to select a value during checkout.

Each option value's price can be set to be Free, Per day or Fixed.
